# UT Austin - MAD Android Lectures
This repository contains the Mobile App Development (MAD) lectures created by Pravat Bhusal.

Each lecture folder contains Markdown file(s) that detail the material taught for the lecture, so if you couldn't understand the lecture during class or need a refresher then this repository is provided for your use. Also feel free to go ahead and learn the future lectures that haven't yet been taught.

### Pull Requests
You can also fork this repository and make pull requests, which I'll review and see if it's appropriate to the lecture.

There's no specified requirement to creating a pull request, just make it as clean and organized as you can.

### Lecture Content
Lecture 1 - Android Studio Basics  
Lecture 2 - Resources, Java + XML

Lecture 4 - Implicit Intents, Fragments  
Lecture 5 - Dependencies, Snackbar, Picasso  
Lecture 6 - Volley, RecyclerView

Each lecture is taught once a week. Don't expect the lectures to teach you everything, but instead it teaches you the foundations of Android development to help you be confident enough to program your own Android applications.
